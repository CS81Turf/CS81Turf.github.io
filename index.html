                <p>
                    I bring a unique blend of real-world grit and tech savvy. By day, I manage lawns — by night, I write clean code and build web apps that solve real problems. Focused, curious, and never afraid to get my hands dirty, I thrive on challenges and love learning new technologies. Whether I'm mowing a lawn or debugging a script, I approach every task with the same level of dedication and attention to detail. Let's connect and see how I can bring this same energy to your team!

                        I apply the right amount of chemicals and fertilizer to lawns to keep them healthy and green. I also manage the IT side of the business, ensuring our systems run smoothly and efficiently. I have developed a web application that allows employees to correctly and efficiently apply the right amount of chemicals and fertilizer to lawns, improving our service quality and customer satisfaction. My role requires a blend of technical skills and hands-on work, allowing me to contribute to both the operational and technological aspects of the business.

                        Maintained the golf course to ensure it was in top condition for players and major tournaments. This included managing the irrigation system, applying fertilizers and pesticides, and overseeing a team of about 40 groundskeepers. My role required a keen eye for detail and a strong understanding of turf management, which I applied to ensure the course met the highest standards of quality.

                        CheMixer is a mobile-friendly web application I built to streamline chemical mixing calculations for our lawn care team. The app features preset formulas, custom input for square footage, and real-time output of chemical quantities required — all displayed in a clean, colorful interface. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive design that works. I designed and developed the entire application from the ground up, focusing on user experience, responsive layout, and practical utility in the field.

                        The Go Green Job Board is a web-based dashboard I'm developing to manage and display daily job assingments for our lawn care team. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app is designed to be displayed on a smart TV at the shop office. I'm actively learning to integrate third-party APIs to update the dashboard with real-time weather data, enhancing our team's ability to plan and execute daily tasks efficiently. This is an ongoing project focusing on improving team communication and operational efficiency.
